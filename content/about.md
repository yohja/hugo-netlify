I've been writing some other blog before, (all of them just died because I'm probably too lazy to maintain those thing). But now I'm here once more trying to write brand new blog and see if I could make it far enough.

I actually just found this new technology (not really new one but at least for me, I just found it and want to give it a try). So I'm using HuGo static site generator to create this blog, and work alongside with Netlify CMS to make everything come to this point.

This time I'll just trying to write anything that come to mind, some might useful for the reader, but other might just some shitty thing, but I'll try to enjoy this as much as I can.

Thank you.
